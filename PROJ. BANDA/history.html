            <p id="history">In the vibrant heart of Houston, Texas, a young Don Toliver found his voice amidst the melodies of the city. Born in 1994, he was surrounded by a diverse musical landscape that shaped his eclectic sound. From a young age, he immersed himself in the rhythms of hip-hop and R&B, inspired by artists who blended genres and pushed boundaries.

Their collaboration ignited a spark, and soon Don was crafting tracks that caught the attention of producers and listeners alike. His unique blend of soulful melodies, atmospheric beats, and honest lyrics set him apart.
                In 2018, a pivotal moment arrived when he collaborated with Travis Scott on the track "Can't Say" from the album Astroworld. This exposure catapulted him into the limelight, showcasing his distinct style and undeniable talent. The world was ready to hear more.
